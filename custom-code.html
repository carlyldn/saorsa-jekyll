  <!-- What is custom code -->

        <h3 class="hamburg-hand">What does custom code mean?</h3>
        <p>Custom code means that we build our websites from the ground up. We don't use any generic templates or drag and drop editors to create our sites, everything is coded on a project to project basis. This gives us an immense amount of flexibility around how our websites are designed which helps <em>you</em> stand out from the crowd.</p>

        <p>Not only is this great from a design point of view, but having a totally custom coded website is a benefit for so many other reasons. They're <em>fast</em>, incredibly secure and you'll be able to update and edit them <em>yourself</em> with our integrated content management system.  Don't worry, you won't need to know a <em>single</em> line of code!</p>

        <p>Our websites are easy to maintain too, completely <em>mobile responsive</em> - and of course - designed completely with <em>your</em> brand aesthetic in mind.</p>
