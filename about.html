        <h3 class="hamburg-hand light">What does custom code mean?</h3>
        <p class="light">Custom code means that we build our websites from the ground up. We don't use any pre-built templates or drag and drop editors to create our sites, everything is coded on a project to project basis. This gives us an immense amount of flexibility around how our websites are designed which helps <em>you</em> stand out from the crowd.</p>

        <p class="light">Not only is this great from a design point of view, but having a totally custom coded website is a benefit for so many other reasons. They're fast, incredibly secure and you'll be able to update and edit them <em>yourself</em> with our integrated content management system.  Don't worry, you won't need to know a single line of code!</p>

        <p class="light">Our websites are easy to maintain too, completely <em>mobile responsive</em> - and of course - tailored with <em>your</em> brand aesthetic in mind.</p>

      <p class="med editable">Hello, I'm Carly and I'm the owner and one-woman show behind Saorsa Studio.</p>
      <p>It can be the scariest thing in the world leaving a secure job behind to chase your dreams, but that’s exactly what I did.  After six years of the <em>eat, sleep, work, repeat</em> routine, the global pandemic hit, and it was a wake-up call that life is too short not to be in a career that excites and fulfils you.</p>
      <p>I decided to take control of my future and try out something completely new.  I dabbled in a little bit of social media, photography and blogging before taking a leap of faith and joining a web development course.  FINALLY, I felt like I had found my purpose!</p>
      <p>I love finding new creative ways to bring a business to life on screen and I’m always learning something new every day.  Being able to work with other likeminded business owners is the cherry on the cake too!</p>
      <p>If you’d like to see how I can help to tell your own story through a beautiful website for your business, get in touch with me below.</p>
