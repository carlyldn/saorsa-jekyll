    <h4 class="big">what is custom <span class="ivy-italic">code?</span></h4>
    <p>Custom code means that we build our websites from the ground up. We don't use any generic templates or drag and drop editors to create our sites, everything is hand coded. This gives us an immense amount of flexibility around how our websites are designed which helps <span class="ivy-italic">you</span> stand out from the crowd.</p>
    <p>Not only is this a benefit from a design point of view, but there are also a number of other benefits to having a custom coded website.</p>

    <div class="col-4 padding-1">
    <h4 class="med">speed</h4>
    <p>Users are extremely impatient when waiting for a website to load, so every second counts! We can get into the technical nitty gritty if you're interested in learning more, but the short version is that we use the latest in static website technology so that your site loads instantly. Not only that, but our sites are coded thoughtfully and intentionally, ensuring that there is no unnecessary code to 'bloat' your load time.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-4 padding-1">
    <h4 class="med">security</h4>
    <p>On top of static sites being incredibly quick to load, they're also much less vulnerable to attacks.  Static sites don't interact with a database, meaning there are FAR less vulnerabilities for potential hackers to exploit. We also use the latest technology to ensure that your site remains secure, so it's one less thing for you to worry about.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-4 padding-1">
    <h4 class="med">responsive</h4>
    <p>Mobile accounts for 50% of web traffic worldwide, so it's important that your website functions just as beautifully on mobile as it does on a desktop.  We make sure that your website is just as user-friendly, and looks just as beautiful on mobile as it does on the web. We also tailor our sites for various other device sizes including tablets and notebooks.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-4 padding-1">
    <h4 class="med">integrated with social media</h4>
    <p>We make sure that your whole website is optimised for when someone shares a page or blog post to social media.  This is something that can often be overlooked, and we ensure there is a relevant description and thumbnail so that when people see your website on socials, they'll be more likely to click through to visit your website and read more.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-4 padding-1">    
    <h4 class="med">analytics & seo</h4>
    <p>We add practical SEO functionality to your site to help you rank in Google searches. You can add and adapt custom meta titles and keywords for each page.  We also work with a Google Analytics specialist who will ensure your website is set up for tracking and can even run and manage Google Ads for you as an optional extra.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-4 padding-1">
    <h4 class="med">easy to update</h4>
    <p>We give you access to our user-friendly CMS where you can update your site without needing to contact us, and without needing to know a single line of code! Of course we're always here to help when you need us, but we'll give you a full walkthrough of how the system works so that you can adapt your site as needed.</p>

    <p class="med">Hi, my name is Carly and I'm the owner and one-woman-show behind Saorsa Studio. It's lovely to meet you!</p>


    <p>I founded Saorsa Studio in late 2021. Like so many other people, the global pandemic was a bit of a wake up call for me. I wasn't truly happy in my 9-5 and started to consider other career paths.  I'd studied a module of web design back at university which I really enjoyed, but never thought to pursue it any further. With that in the back of my mind, I decided to take a leap of faith and join a web development course in late 2021.  I fell back in love with the process and shortly after, Saorsa Studio was born.</p>
        
    <p>I've discovered a passion for not only the development side of things, but the design side too. I love researching design principles across different mediums, from cinema, photography, branding and more. 
        
    <p>To be able to design, code and build a site from the ground up is truly so rewarding. Web development is always changing too, so it's exciting to work in an industry where I can constantly learn and grow as technology adapts.
        
    <p>Outside of work, I absolutely love to travel.  I dream of doing van life or living in a warmer climate at some stage, so watch this space for a global takeover!</p>

    <p>If you have a project that you'd like to chat about, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
