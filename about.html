        <p class="med">Hello, I'm Carly and I'm the owner and one-woman-show behind Saorsa Studio.</p>
        <p>The idea of Saorsa Studio was born after I was approaching 6 years working in the same office job. I longed for a sense of freedom and to escape the <span class="ivy-italic">eat, sleep, work, repeat</span> routine. I left office life behind and feel as though I have found my purpose in web development. I love that every day brings new design and tech challenges along with opportunities to work with other likeminded business owners!</p>

        <p>There's no better feeling for me than being a small part of helping your business thrive. If you'd like to chat over a virtual or in person coffee to discuss a project, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
