            <p>Saorsa Studio was born during the global pandemic after I was approaching 6 years working in the same office job. I longed to escape the <span class="ivy-italic">eat, sleep, work, repeat</span> routine. Despite the security of my job in those — <span class="ivy-italic">*unprecedented times*</span> — I decided that it was time for me to go in search of a more meaningful and creative role.</p>

            <p>This is where the name ‘Saorsa’ came from, it means ‘freedom’ in Scottish Gaelic.  It represents the decision to quit my 9-5 and follow my dreams. It also felt fitting given that I also have the freedom to design and build totally custom coded online spaces for you!</p>

            <p>I took a leap of faith and joined a web development course after having dabbled in it a little at university. I instantly knew that this would be a career path I would love, and I feel as though I have found my purpose - and an immense sense of freedom along with it.</p>

        <p>Users are extremely impatient when waiting for a website to load, so every second counts! We can get into the technical nitty gritty if you're interested in learning more, but the short version is that we use the latest in static website technology so that your site loads instantly. Not only that, but our sites are coded thoughtfully and intentionally, ensuring that there is no unnecessary code to 'bloat' your load time.</p>

        <div class="col-4 p1">
        <h4 class="med">security</h4>
        <p>On top of static sites being incredibly quick to load, they're also much less vulnerable to attacks.  Static sites don't interact with a database, meaning there are FAR less vulnerabilities for potential hackers to exploit. We also use the latest technology to ensure that your site remains secure, so it's one less thing for you to worry about.</p>

        <p>Mobile accounts for 50% of web traffic worldwide, so it's important that your website functions just as beautifully on mobile as it does on a desktop.  We make sure that your website is just as user-friendly, and looks just as beautiful on mobile as it does on the web. We also tailor our sites for various other device sizes including tablets and notebooks.

        <div class="col-4 p1">
        <h4 class="med">integrated with social media</h4>
        <p>We make sure that your whole website is optimised for when someone shares a page or blog post to social media.  This is something that can often be overlooked, and we ensure there is a relevant description and thumbnail so that when people see your website on socials, they'll be more likely to click through to visit your website and read more.</p>

        <p class="med">Hi, my name is Carly and I'm the owner and one-woman-show behind Saorsa Studio. It's lovely to meet you!</p>


        <p>‘Saorsa’ comes from the Scottish Gaelic word for ‘freedom’. It embodies a lot of what our brand is all about, having the freedom to design and build totally custom coded online spaces. It also means a lot to me on a personal level.</p>
        
        <p>In 2021 (in the midst of the global pandemic), I decided to quit my full-time office job. I'd been there for nearly 6 years and the pandemic was a wake up call that life is too short not to be in a career that fulfils you. Whilst I didn't dislike my job by any means, I knew that the typical 9-5 life wasn't for me.</p>
            
        <p>In search of a more creative role where I could work closely with small businesses, I took a leap of faith and joined a web development course in late 2021. Almost immediately I knew that this was exactly the type of role that would make me fall in love with Mondays again! To be able to design, code and build a site from the ground up is truly so rewarding.</p>
                    
        <p>Outside of work, I absolutely love to travel.  London is currently where I call home, however I dream of doing van life or living in a warmer climate at some stage. Watch this space for a global takeover!</p>

        <p>If you have a project that you'd like to chat about, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
