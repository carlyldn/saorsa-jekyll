        <h3 class="hamburg-hand">What does custom code mean?</h3>
        <p>Custom code means that we build our websites from the ground up. We don't use any generic templates or drag and drop editors to create our sites, everything is coded on a project to project basis. This gives us an immense amount of flexibility around how our websites are designed which helps <em>you</em> stand out from the crowd.</p>

        <p>Not only is this great from a design point of view, but having a totally custom coded website is a benefit for so many other reasons. They're <em>fast</em>, incredibly secure and you'll be able to update and edit them <em>yourself</em> with our integrated content management system.  Don't worry, you won't need to know a <em>single</em> line of code!</p>

        <p>Our websites are easy to maintain too, completely <em>mobile responsive</em> - and of course - designed completely with <em>your</em> brand aesthetic in mind.</p>

        <p class="med">Hello, I'm Carly and I'm the owner and one-woman-show behind Saorsa Studio.</p>
        <p>The idea of Saorsa Studio was born after I was approaching 6 years working in the same office job. I longed for a sense of freedom and to escape the <em>eat, sleep, work, repeat</em> routine. I left office life behind and feel as though I have found my purpose in web development. I love that every day brings new design and tech challenges along with opportunities to work with other likeminded business owners!</p>

        <p>There's no better feeling for me than being a small part of helping your business thrive. If you'd like to chat over a virtual or in person coffee to discuss a project, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
