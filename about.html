        <p class="med">Hello, I'm Carly and I'm the owner and one-woman-show behind Saorsa Studio.</p>
        <p>The idea of Saorsa Studio was born after I was approaching 6 years working in the same office job. I longed for a sense of freedom and to escape the <span class="ivy-italic">eat, sleep, work, repeat</span> routine. I left office life behind and feel as though I have found my purpose in web development. I love that every day brings new design and tech challenges along with opportunities to work with other likeminded business owners!</p>

        <p>There's no better feeling for me than being a small part of helping your business thrive. If you'd like to chat over a virtual or in person coffee to discuss a project, I'd love to hear from you.</p>

        <h4 class="med">speed</h4>
        <p>Users are extremely impatient when waiting for a website to load, so every second counts! We can get into the technical nitty gritty if you're interested in learning more, but the short version is that we use the latest in static website technology so that your site loads instantly. Not only that, but our sites are coded thoughtfully and intentionally, ensuring that there is no unnecessary code to 'bloat' your load time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="col-4 p1">
        <h4 class="med">security</h4>
        <p>On top of static sites being incredibly quick to load, they're also much less vulnerable to attacks.  Static sites don't interact with a database, meaning there are FAR less vulnerabilities for potential hackers to exploit. We also use the latest technology to ensure that your site remains secure, so it's one less thing for you to worry about.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-4 p1">
        <h4 class="med">responsive</h4>
        <p>Mobile accounts for 50% of web traffic worldwide, so it's important that your website functions just as beautifully on mobile as it does on a desktop.  We make sure that your website is just as user-friendly, and looks just as beautiful on mobile as it does on the web. We also tailor our sites for various other device sizes including tablets and notebooks.

        <div class="col-4 p1">
        <h4 class="med">integrated with social media</h4>
        <p>We make sure that your whole website is optimised for when someone shares a page or blog post to social media.  This is something that can often be overlooked, and we ensure there is a relevant description and thumbnail so that when people see your website on socials, they'll be more likely to click through to visit your website and read more.</p>

        <div class="col-4 p1">    
        <h4 class="med">analytics & seo</h4>
        <p>We add practical SEO functionality to your site to help you rank in Google searches. You can add and adapt custom meta titles and keywords for each page.  We also work with a Google Analytics specialist who will ensure your website is set up for tracking and can even run and manage Google Ads for you as an optional extra.</p>

        <p class="med">Hi, my name is Carly and I'm the owner and one-woman-show behind Saorsa Studio. It's lovely to meet you!</p>


        <p>‘Saorsa’ comes from the Scottish Gaelic word for ‘freedom’. It embodies a lot of what our brand is all about, having the freedom to design and build totally custom coded online spaces. It also means a lot to me on a personal level.</p>
        
        <p>In 2021 (in the midst of the global pandemic), I decided to quit my full-time office job. I'd been there for nearly 6 years and the pandemic was a wake up call that life is too short not to be in a career that fulfils you. Whilst I didn't dislike my job by any means, I knew that the typical 9-5 life wasn't for me.</p>
            
        <p>In search of a more creative role where I could work closely with small businesses, I took a leap of faith and joined a web development course in late 2021. Almost immediately I knew that this was exactly the type of role that would make me fall in love with Mondays again! To be able to design, code and build a site from the ground up is truly so rewarding.</p>
                    
        <p>Outside of work, I absolutely love to travel.  London is currently where I call home, however I dream of doing van life or living in a warmer climate at some stage. Watch this space for a global takeover!</p>

        <p>If you have a project that you'd like to chat about, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
