Why custom code?
- We may be biased, but having a totally custom coded website is a benefit for SO many reasons. First of all, we build our sites using the latest in static site technology.  This means your website will have a fast load time which is essential in a world where consumer attention spans are getting shorter by the day. The longer your site takes to load, the higher the chance of you losing out on sales, views and clicks.




The great thing about having a custom coded site is that they're so flexible. Maybe you need a single page site for your business now, but in a year you might want to add more pages or a blog. We're here to support you with your website in the present and in the future as your business grows and adapts! We also give you access to our amazing content management system so that you can make instant changes to imagery and copy yourself. 

Perfect blend between us taking care of technical bits while they still get access to the CMS to change imagery/text.
