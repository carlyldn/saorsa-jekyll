            <p>Let us design and build a website for you that is completely custom coded and doesn’t tie you down to any specific platform.  There are endless website builders out there - Squarespace, WordPress, Showit, Shopify… the list goes on.  We don't use any of these and build everything from scratch.</p>
            <p>We don't just design with aesthetics in mind, we design with strategy.  We put your business goals at the heart of our whole process, making sure we add relevant call to actions and content blocks.</p>

            <p>So, you’ve got a website and it’s served its purpose for your business so far, but now you’re ready to take it to the next level with something shiny and new… let’s talk! </p>
            <p>We’ll discuss what you like and dislike about your current website and come up with a strategy on how to make your new site work for your needs.  Whether your current site is on WordPress, SquareSpace or any other website drag and drop builder, we’ll help get your domain transferred to our preferred hosting provider and take care of all the back end techy stuff.</p>

            <h3 class="hamburg-hand">How much does it cost?</h2>
            <p>The juicy bit... we understand that a website is a big investment for any business, especially if you're just starting out. We strive to keep things as cost effective for you as possible whilst still delivering exceptional service.</p>
            <p>Each website will be completely bespoke and so pricing can vary depending on the complexity of the site. We are however currently offering an introductory price of £1,500.00 for a four-page site to celebrate our launch!</p>
            <p>If you’re looking for a smaller site or to add additional pages, we’d love to discuss your needs and will put together a proposal for you.</p>
            <p>The great thing about custom coded sites is that they are extremely flexible and can be adapted over time as your business grows.  You might be looking for a simple website now as your business gets off the ground, and then later down the line you may wish to expand your offerings and introduce more pages or a blog.</p>
            <p>Visit our contact page to complete a short questionnaire and we’ll be in touch to book in a no-obligation consultation call.</p>
