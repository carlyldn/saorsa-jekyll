            <h3 class="med">What does custom code mean?</h3>
                <p>Custom code means that we build our websites from the ground up. We don't use any generic templates or drag and drop editors to create our sites, everything is coded on a project to project basis. This gives us an immense amount of flexibility around how our websites are designed which helps <span class="ivy-italic">you</span> stand out from the crowd.</p>

                <p>Not only is this great from a design point of view, and we may be biased, but having a totally custom coded website is a benefit for SO many reasons. They're <span class="ivy-italic">fast</span>, incredibly secure and you'll be able to update and edit them <span class="ivy-italic">yourself</span> with our integrated content management system.  Don't worry, you won't need to know a <span class="ivy-italic">single</span> line of code!</p>

                <p>Our websites are easy to maintain too, completely <span class="ivy-italic">mobile responsive</span> - and of course - designed completely with <span class="ivy-italic">your</span> brand aesthetic in mind.</p>

            <div class="label">Fast loading</div>
            <div class="content">Users are extremely impatient when waiting for a website to load, so every second counts! We can get into the technical nitty gritty if you're interested in learning more, but the short version is that we use the latest in static website technology so that your site loads instantly. Not only that, but our sites are coded thoughtfully and intentionally, ensuring that there is no unnecessary code to 'bloat' your load time.

            <div class="content">On top of static sites being incredibly quick to load, they're also much less vulnerable to attacks.  Static sites don't interact with a database, meaning there are FAR less vulnerabilities for potential hackers to exploit. We also use the latest technology to ensure that your site remains secure, so it's one less thing for you to worry about.</div>

            <div class="content">We make sure that your whole website is optimised for when someone shares a page or blog post to social media.  This is something that can often be overlooked, and we ensure there is a relevant description and thumbnail so that when people see your website on socials, they'll be more likely to click through to visit your website and read more.</div>
