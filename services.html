    <!-- What is custom code -->

            <h3 class="med">What does custom code mean?</h3>
                <p>Custom code means that we build our websites from the ground up. We don't use any generic templates or drag and drop editors to create our sites, everything is coded on a project to project basis. This gives us an immense amount of flexibility around how our websites are designed which helps <span class="ivy-italic">you</span> stand out from the crowd.</p>

                <p>Not only is this great from a design point of view, and we may be biased, but having a totally custom coded website is a benefit for SO many reasons. They're <span class="ivy-italic">fast</span>, incredibly secure and you'll be able to update and edit them <span class="ivy-italic">yourself</span> with our integrated content management system.  Don't worry, you won't need to know a <span class="ivy-italic">single</span> line of code!</p>

                <p>Our websites are easy to maintain too, completely <span class="ivy-italic">mobile responsive</span> - and of course - designed completely with <span class="ivy-italic">your</span> brand aesthetic in mind.</p>
